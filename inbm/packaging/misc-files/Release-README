QUICK README
=============
1.  To install both TC and BC run the install-inb.sh script with root privileges. Before running the script update the following fields in azure_conf_file with the necessary information to have device connected to cloud.
        - SCOPE_ID <refer Azure user guide documentation on how to fetch SCOPE_ID>
        - DEVICE_ID <a pretag to the device. The device-id will be later generated with an appended uuid later>
        - PRIMARY_KEY <refer Azure user guide documentation on how to fetch PRIMARY_KEY>

    To install only BC, run the command 'sudo ./install-inb.sh hddl'

2.  When installed TC and BC by running install-inb.sh, the device will be automatically on-boarded to Azure cloud using SAS primary key. The device-id generated will be stored under /usr/share/azure_conf_file. 
        Use this device-id info to check the device on the Azure cloud (https://intel-inband-manageability.azureiotcentral.com/devices).
        NOTE: Azure Auto-onboarding is supported only via SAS token.

3.  To uninstall, run 'sudo ./uninstall-inb.sh'
